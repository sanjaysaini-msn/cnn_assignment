# Cancer Detection using CNN based model
> Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

## Objective
- This assignment uses a dataset of about 2365 images of skin cancer types. (2247 and 118 in each train and test respectively) The dataset contains 9 sub-directories in each train and test subdirectories. The 9 sub-directories contains the images of 9 skin cancer types respectively.
- Create a CNN model, which can accurately detect 9 classes.
- Choose an appropriate optimiser and loss function for model training
- Train the model for ~30 epochs
- Explain the findings
